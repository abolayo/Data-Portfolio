 [Predict Bankruptcy]('interact%20%20with%20app')

<p>Introducing our innovative bankruptcy-predicting model built with a Random Forest classifier!
Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, our model analyzes a diverse set of financial indicators to accurately
predict the likelihood of bankruptcy for businesses. By harnessing the power of Random Forest algorithms, we provide
robust and reliable predictions, empowering organizations to proactively mitigate financial risks and make informed
decisions to safeguard their investments. </p>

#### [Stock Volatility](https://github.com/abolayo/wqu_learnings/blob/master/Volatility/project.ipynb)
<p>Introducing our cutting-edge time series volatility-predicting model built with an ARCH (Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroskedasticity) model! Our model utilizes sophisticated econometric techniques to analyze historical data and
forecast future volatility levels in financial markets. By incorporating ARCH modeling, we accurately capture the
time-varying nature of volatility, enabling investors and financial institutions to make informed decisions and manage
risk effectively in dynamic market environments.</p>
